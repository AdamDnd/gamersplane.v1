		<h1>Forum Rules</h1>
		
		<h2>General guidelines for the forums</h2>
		<p>Gamers Plane is open anyone, regardless of age, and as such, members are expected to follow certain guidelines.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Treat all members with respsect.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Any use of racial, ethnic, religious, or gender slurs will not be tolerated.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Keep all discussion PG-13 (with minor exception, see below). That basically means:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>No pornography or descriptions of pornography</li>
				<li>No heavy cursing</li>
				<li>No violence or depictions of violence</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Post should not be spammy. Keep a post limited to 3 images, and make them images somewhat relevant.</li>
			<li>No insulting people, directly or indirectly. Don't insult another player, a players family, a random stranger.</li>
			<li>No hot button topics outside the gaming realm, including but not limited to politics, religion, etc., unless permitted by a moderator.</li>
			<li>Do not post anything libelous or threatening.</li>
			<li>No promoting commercial products not sanctioned by GP.</li>
			<li>Any actions meant to harm GP, its server, or its content, or actions meant to circumvent its security are prohibited.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I'm sad I have to actually put this as a rule, but if you join Gamers' Plane just to promote material on other play-by-post sites, I will just go ahead and ban your account. I don't mind people talking about other sites, if you're an active participant here. But coming here just to get people away from here is crass and rude.</p>

		<h2>Rules for specific forums</h2>
		<p>The General Discussion forum is for most discussions that don't belong in other forums. Discussions on games should go in the appropriate Game Discussions forum, ideas/problems about the site under Site discussions, and game requests under Games Tavern. Anything else goes in General Discussions.</p>
		<p>Threads/posts should have a content and purpose, be it to introduce yourself or start a discussion on a topic.</p>
		
		<p>We will allow the rules for language used in Game Forums (other then the Games Tavern) to be looser, as long as it is clearly printed at the root forum/game details. However, players are still expected to treat each other with respect, to not use slurs against other players, etc.</p>
		
		<hr>
		<h2>Moderator responsibilities</h2>
		<p>The moderators can decide whether a post meets these guidelines or not. You are welcome to contest a decision via private message, but simply whining/arguing may raise your punishment.</p>
